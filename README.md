This is a repository for a Chinese Word Segmentation Tool.
I built it with simple enumerate way and an improved version based on viterbi algorithm.

I left two method to finish the Enumerate way, dictionary based and input based.

You can access the dictionary file as enumerate_old file, and enumerate file for another.

You can check them out as follow:
- [Enumerate&input based](./enumerate.ipynb)
- [Enumerate&dic based](./enumerate_old.ipynb)
- [Viterbi based](./viterbi.ipynb)

The file located on the path of `/data/` is the dataset used as dictionary, you can check it out on [here](/data/).

If you have any question, take it easy to contact me on [my blog](https://blog.cha.moe/article/cec83ef9.html) comment area.
